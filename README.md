# Animator As Code

**Animator As Code** is a small Unity Editor facility to generate Avatars 3.0 Animator layers and animations from a [fluent builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) syntax written in C#.

Describing your animators as code provides the following advantages:

- you do not need to edit your animations by hand every time you add remove or change the location of a component in your hierarchy
- you will not need to edit a hundred transitions by hand if you need to rectify your animator

It is written with VRChat Avatars 3.0 use cases in mind; the API is opinionated to facilitate writing such animators in a concise way, hopefully requiring as little additional tweaking.

Check the docs for information on how to install and example code snippets.
