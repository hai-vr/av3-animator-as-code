Animator As Code V1
====

**Animator As Code** is a small Unity Editor facility to generate Animator layers and animations from a [fluent builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) syntax written in C#.

Describing your animators as code provides the following advantages:

- you do not need to edit your animations by hand every time you add remove or change the location of a component in your hierarchy
- you will not need to edit a hundred transitions by hand if you need to rectify your animator

Initially designed for use in VRChat to create Avatars 3.0 animator controllers, this is now a generic package that does not require it.

Initially created by **[@hai-vr](https://github.com/hai-vr)**,
- with major contributions from **[@galister](https://github.com/galister)** for supporting sub-state machines and the generic use of nodes and parameters.
